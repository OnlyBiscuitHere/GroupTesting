[Verse 1]
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
[To train them is my cause](https://genius.com/805674/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/To-train-them-is-my-cause)
[I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide](https://genius.com/632069/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/I-will-travel-across-the-land-searching-far-and-wide)
[Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside](https://genius.com/632070/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/Teach-pokemon-to-understand-the-power-thats-inside)

[Chorus]
(Pokémon, gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
[(Pokémon) Oh, you're my best friend](https://genius.com/1602136/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/Pokemon-oh-youre-my-best-friend)
[In a world we must defend](https://genius.com/633507/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/In-a-world-we-must-defend)
(Pokémon, gotta catch 'em all) A heart so true
[Our courage will pull us through](https://genius.com/3889259/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/Our-courage-will-pull-us-through)

[Verse 2]
[Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place](https://genius.com/4301249/Pokemon-pokemon-theme-gotta-catch-em-all/Every-challenge-along-the-way-with-courage-i-will-face-i-will-battle-every-day-to-claim-my-rightful-place)
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

[Chorus]
(Pokémon, gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
